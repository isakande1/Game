  Project # 3
  Project description:  -To allow a user to play rock, paper, sissors against the computer, 
                        -Require  the user to input their name, 
						-Ask  the user to inpput howmany times to play, 
						-Keep track of the round currently playing.
			            -keeps tracks of the record of the game,
  			            -Kepps track of the records of all games  played with the same username,
			            -keeps track of the total number of times played with the same username
						-Keep asking for valid character if the user enter an invalid character
                        -Convert uppercase input to lower case.	
                        -The program use Scanner methods when the required input is an integer to keep verifying the user
						   input and discard the input in case it is a character. In this case,the input is read only if
						   it is an integer						
                        					
						
  Purpose: create file, input and ouput on file, get familiar with scanner object and methods, while loop, for loop, scope, 

  What the program does: -Allows the user to paly rock, paper and scissors against the computer with a username.
                         -If the  user enter an invalid input when the program requires an integer, the input will be discard and the 
						   user will be ask to enter an integer.
                         -Display what round of the game the user is playing.  
                         -Display the records of wins, losses, and ties at the end of the execution of the programm
						 -Display the total records for all games played with the same username
						 
  
  How you tested the program: Run the program multiple times with the same username and with diffrent username.
  Limitations if any in the program: none.
